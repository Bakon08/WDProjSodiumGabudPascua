          This will be the "main" webpage of the website. This is where you note 
          down the tasks you have and when they are due. You are also able to update 
          your progress on the task you are working on. We will add a feature where you
          will be able to note down the task type like school, house, family, personal, etc.\
          this would help you organize you tasks across different backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the typical planner website where you can note down tasks but we format 
          it in a way that is very organizd and easy to understand. It would also prioritize the 
          earliest due date to be on the top while the later ones to be at the bottom. There isn't 
          anything too special about this webpage but becasue it is connected to the other 
          webpages, it becomes a very powerful tool for productivity.
